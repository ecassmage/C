First we Write the line before fork, my pid is %d Just to make sure we all know who the Parent is in this Relationship

Next We Have a Child. This Child Grows up Nice and Strong and after Their Parent has another child gets Jealous and
Has a Child of their own. This Continues on Again and Again until we have 7 Children + 1 Parent
Basically as Long as nothing is interrupted prematurely, The number of Parents and Children That will have existed
will always Equal 2^(Number of forks)
ie:
0 Forks = 1 Process
1 Fork  = 2 Process
2 Forks = 4 Process
3 Forks = 8 Process
4 Forks = 16 Process
5 Forks = 32 Process

Family Tree Of Sorts I guess. Not Sure if This will Mess up upon upload or something But if it does
